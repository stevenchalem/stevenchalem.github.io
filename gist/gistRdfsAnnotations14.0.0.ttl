		"NOTE: Based on the Open World Assumption, the assigner may not be asserted or known."^^xsd:string ,
		"NOTE: For some assignments, such as the assignment of a person to a task, it may seem equally correct in ordinary speech to say it is an assignment of a task to a person. Since gist:isAssignmentTo and gist:isAssignmentOf have no formal domains or ranges, the choice of which predicate to use for which is left as an implementation decision.

		"NOTE: Often a type can be modeled either as an owl:Class or as a gist:Category. Use the latter if you don't care much about the formal structure of the different types, or if there is a whole hierarchy of types that are going to be managed by a group separate from the ontology developers. The formal structure may be defined elsewhere and linked to, if necessary."^^xsd:string

		"EXAMPLE: A jury is a group of people; a financial ledger is a collection of transaction entries; a route is an (ordered) collection of segments."^^xsd:string ,

gist:Commitment
	rdfs:label "Commitment"^^xsd:string ;
	rdfs:comment
		"DEFINITION: A promise made by a single party to one or more parties to do or not do something or act in a particular way."^^xsd:string ,
		"EXAMPLE: Upon selling a treasury bill, the U.S. government makes a commitment to pay the purchaser a stated amount of money at a stated time."^^xsd:string ,
		"EXAMPLE: When signing an NDA, the signatory commits to keeping specified information confidential."^^xsd:string ,
		"NOTE: A commitment is unilateral in that it is binding on only one party. This contrasts with gist:Agreement, which consists of commitments that bind two or more parties."^^xsd:string ,
		"NOTE: A single commitment may be made to multiple parties at once; it is a single commitment rather than multiple commitments if the same action would fulfill the obligation to all the parties simultaneously. For example, a performer makes a single commitment to hold a performance to all ticket purchasers; by holding the performance, the commitment to all parties is fulfilled in a single action."^^xsd:string ,

	rdfs:comment
		"DEFINITION: Something that, while having an independent existence, is inherently part of or designed to be part of a larger entity, such as a system or network."^^xsd:string ,
		"NOTE: A component may be designed or intended as part of a whole without actually being so; e.g., a car steering wheel that is not installed in any car."^^xsd:string ,
		"NOTE: Many things are in a trivial sense a part of a larger thing, but are not considered components because they are not inherently part of that larger thing. For example, while a book may be part of a library (a collection of books), it is not inherently so, and thus is not a component. A playing card, on the other hand, could be considered a component in (member of) a deck of cards. This may be use case-dependent; e.g., car parts might be modeled as components in an automobile manufacturing context but not in a retail auto parts store."^^xsd:string ,
		"NOTE: Physical substances, such as ingredients in a cake batter, do not meet the independent existence criterion, so are not components."^^xsd:string ,
		"NOTE: This class is not disjoint with gist:Composite, because a component may itself break down into smaller components."^^xsd:string ,

		"NOTE: Some composites, like systems, networks, and ordered collections, have internal organization, while others, such as unordered collections, typically do not."^^xsd:string ,

gist:KnowledgeConcept
	rdfs:label "Knowledge Concept"^^xsd:string ;
	rdfs:comment
		"DEFINITION: An abstract concept that arises from the distillation of experience. It is similar to a category but, rather than being a simple tag, it has rich structure."^^xsd:string ,
		"EXAMPLE: Most domains will define a few subclasses, such as gene, protein, chemical, disease, subject matter, industry, method."^^xsd:string ,
		"""NOTE: Some knowledge is about specific instances that already exist in the knowledge graph. We may have knowledge that Judge Jones is more lenient on repeat offenders in the morning; we may know that the earliest killing frost in Fort Collins is the last week of September.

These fit the broader definition of knowledge, the distillation of experience. But they do not require any new instances.  Judge Jones and Fort Collins already exist and have a place in our knowledge graph.

But some knowledge requires that we synthesize new instances in order to have a place to consolidate the knowledge.  A disease isn't a tangible thing, like a person or a building. A disease is a prediction that a person's health will decline in a predictable way (without treatment and with treatment). The number of diseases continues to grow as we collectively learn more and more granular distinctions. Lung cancer used to be a single disease, but now we have dozens of fine-grained distinctions; e.g., non-lymphoma small cell fusiform is different from alveolar adenocarcinoma because we now know the prognosis and treatment are different.

This superclass is meant as a place for subclasses that will have the instances that represent the foci of the knowledge we have acquired. Note the distinction between a particular portion of, say, gold, which instantiates gist:PhysicalSubstance, and the concept of gold, which instantiates gist:KnowledgeConcept.

In some ontologies what we are calling knowledge concepts are defined as classes; e.g., non-lymphoma small cell fusiform and alveolar adenocarcinoma would be two classes rather than two instances. But using a class makes it harder to connect the concept to other instances in a knowledge graph, and furthermore such classes would lack instances."""^^xsd:string

The subproperties allow the ontologist to do three things:
1) Distinguish start and end times.
2) Indicate whether a time is planned or actual. This is useful for everything from project management to calendar appointments and the like. It is also useful for date effectivities; i.e., something valid up to a planned date).
3) Distinguish varying levels of precision; sort of a simple version of the Allen functions.

All datetimes are of the same format: '2021-06-01T08:03:27.12324-6:00'^^xsd:dateTime. This is compatible with and a subset of ISO 8601.

Time zone offset, such as -6:00 (of which there are a few dozen) is recognized in the date itself, as shown. The actual time zone standard (of which there are 131) may optionally be attached to the event or other object itself.

There will be many historical dates that do not have a time zone offset (e.g., Lincoln's birthday, as well as about 75% of all legacy systems), and in that case the offset can be omitted.

The conventions for precision that are repeated in each property name are as follows:
	- *DateTime is an abstraction over the various precisions of its subproperties.
	- *Date refers to a calendar date (e.g., birthdays and invoice dates) and is assumed to have precision of one day. Time zone offset is allowed.
	- *Minute refers to clock time; e.g., a meeting will start at 9:15 with a timezone offset. Precision is assumed to have precision of one minute.
