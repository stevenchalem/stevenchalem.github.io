But they do not require any new instances.  Judge Jones and Fort Collins already exist and have a place in our knowledge graph.\r\n\r\nBut some knowledge requires that we synthesize new instances in order to have a place to consolidate the knowledge.  A disease isn't a tangible thing, like a person or a building. A disease is a prediction that a person's health will decline in a predictable way (without treatment and with treatment). The number of diseases continues to grow as we collectively learn more and more granular distinctions. Lung cancer used to be a single disease, but now we have dozens of fine-grained distinctions; e.g., non-lymphoma small cell fusiform is different from alveolar adenocarcinoma because we now know the prognosis and treatment are different.\r\n\r\nThis superclass is meant as a place for subclasses that will have the instances that represent the foci of the knowledge we have acquired. Note the distinction between a particular portion of, say, gold, which instantiates gist:PhysicalSubstance, and the concept of gold, which instantiates gist:KnowledgeConcept.\r\n\r\nIn some ontologies what we are calling knowledge concepts are defined as classes; e.g., non-lymphoma small cell fusiform and alveolar adenocarcinoma would be two classes rather than two instances.

This is useful for everything from project management to calendar appointments and the like. It is also useful for date effectivities; i.e., something valid up to a planned date).\r\n3) Distinguish varying levels of precision; sort of a simple version of the Allen functions.\r\n\r\nAll datetimes are of the same format: '2021-06-01T08:03:27.12324-6:00'^^xsd:dateTime. This is compatible with and a subset of ISO 8601.\r\n\r\nTime zone offset, such as -6:00 (of which there are a few dozen) is recognized in the date itself, as shown. The actual time zone standard (of which there are 131) may optionally be attached to the event or other object itself.\r\n\r\nThere will be many historical dates that do not have a time zone offset (e.g., Lincoln's birthday, as well as about 75% of all legacy systems), and in that case the offset can be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe conventions for precision that are repeated in each property name are as follows:\r\n	- *DateTime is an abstraction over the various precisions of its subproperties.\r\n	- *Date refers to a calendar date (e.g., birthdays and invoice dates) and is assumed to have precision of one day. Time zone offset is allowed.\r\n	- *Minute refers to clock time; e.g., a meeting will start at 9:15 with a timezone offset. Precision is assumed to have precision of one minute.\r\n	- *Microsecond refers to system time, and it will be as precise as the system can supply; typically at least milliseconds, sometime microseconds.\r\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .
